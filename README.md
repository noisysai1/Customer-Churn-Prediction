📊 Step 1: Data Understanding & Description
Dataset Overview
The dataset Churn_Modelling.csv typically includes:

Customer information: Customer ID, surname, geography, gender, age.

Account information: Credit score, balance, tenure, number of products, etc.

Service and churn details: Whether the customer exited (churned) or not (target variable).

Key Columns to Note
RowNumber: Index of the record.

CustomerId: Unique identifier.

Surname: Customer's last name.

Geography: Country (France, Spain, Germany).

Gender: Male or Female.

Age: Age of the customer.

Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.

Balance: Account balance.

NumOfProducts: Number of bank products the customer uses.

HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member.

EstimatedSalary: Estimated salary of the customer.

Exited: Target variable (1 = Customer left, 0 = Retained).

🧹 Step 2: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
✅ Tools to Use:
Pandas: Data manipulation, reading CSV, handling missing values.

NumPy: Numerical operations and transformations.

✅ Actions:
Load data using pandas.read_csv().

Handle missing values with fillna() or dropna().

Encode categorical features (Geography, Gender) using pd.get_dummies() or LabelEncoder.

Scale numerical columns using StandardScaler from Scikit-learn.

📊 Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Tools to Use:
Matplotlib: Plotting histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.

Seaborn: Heatmaps, pair plots, and distribution analysis.

✅ Actions:
Visualize feature distributions.

Identify correlations using seaborn.heatmap().

Analyze feature importance with boxplots and pair plots.

🛠️ Step 4: Feature Engineering
✅ Tools to Use:
Pandas: For transforming and engineering features.

Scikit-learn: For scaling and splitting datasets.

✅ Actions:
Create new features if needed.

Normalize/standardize data using StandardScaler().

Split data into training and testing sets using train_test_split().

🧠 Step 5: Apply Machine Learning Models
✅ Tools to Use:
Scikit-learn: For classification models.

TensorFlow/Keras: For neural network models.

✅ Actions:
Use classification models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting


📈 Step 6: Model Evaluation
✅ Tools to Use:
Scikit-learn: For model evaluation metrics.

✅ Actions:
Use accuracy_score(), precision_score(), recall_score(), and roc_auc_score().

Plot confusion matrices using seaborn.heatmap().

🚀 Step 7: Model Deployment 
✅ Tools to Use:
Flask/Streamlit: To build an API or web app.
